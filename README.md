Polyfill unserialize
====================

Build status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dbrumann/polyfill-unserialize.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dbrumann/polyfill-unserialize)

Backports unserialize options introduced in PHP 7.0 to older PHP versions.

This is intended as a proof of concept to maybe introduce this to Symfony's polyfill library:
